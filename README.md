# JustTaste Web Application

## Description
JustTaste is a web application designed for logging user flavor preferences and building analysis for creating and honing dish taste profiles. It incorporates user authentication, optimized search functionality, and dashboard features.

## Features
- User authentication: Securely log in and manage your flavor preferences.
- Flavor analysis: Analyze and refine dish taste profiles based on user preferences.
- Optimized search: Quickly find dishes based on specific flavor criteria.
- Dashboard: Visualize and track your flavor preferences over time.

## Database Design
The database design has been enhanced to ensure real-time data storage and retrieval, resulting in an improved user experience.

## Security Measures
To ensure secure data handling and application integrity, the following measures have been implemented:
- Password hashing: User passwords are securely hashed to protect sensitive information.
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS): CORS is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to resources.

## Neurobiological Investigation
As part of the development process, an investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms of taste preferences was conducted. This research has led to the proposal of a hypothesis for future food likings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the database and configure the connection settings.
